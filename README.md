# Interactive-ASL-Fingerspelling-Recognition-System
Fingerspelling  Recognition System that uses machine learning techniques, Arduino, python

**Overview**
The Interactive ASL Fingerspelling Recognition System is a project aimed at recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling gestures using machine learning techniques. This system integrates Python for machine learning algorithms, Arduino for output, and computer vision techniques for gesture recognition.

**Features**
  - Real-time recognition of ASL fingerspelling gestures.
  - Machine learning model trained to classify ASL gestures.
  - Audio and visual output by Arduino

**Requirements**
  - Latest version of Python
  - Arduino idea
  - TensorFlow and Teachable machine(https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) (for machine learning module)
  - OpenCV (for computer vision tasks)
  - Arduino components: Arduino board(mega preferred), SD card, LED or LCD screen, speaker, SD card reader
